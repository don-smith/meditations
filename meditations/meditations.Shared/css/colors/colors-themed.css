@import url(/css/colors-themed.theme-light.css);

/*
    At runtime, on Windows Phone, colors-themed.css resolves to 
    colors-themed.theme-light.css or colors-themed.theme-dark.css 
    based on the user’s theme setting. This is part of the MRT 
    resource loading functionality.

    For more information, see:
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh965372.aspx

    The import above is the default for Windows Store apps.

    All color-specific styles should be placed in the appropriate
    theme file (*.theme-light.less or *.theme-dark.less). Don't
    edit the theme CSS files since they are rebuilt from the 
    LESS files.
